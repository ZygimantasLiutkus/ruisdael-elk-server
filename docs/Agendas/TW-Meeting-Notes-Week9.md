## Notes

List of questions: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PVclD1e_Yg_JuhBKK9TEQlGt85aK97y7USCQrhtQZeU/edit?pli=1

- Title page is in order.

- Keep the reader in mind?
	- Design and implementation should only be in the Summary if this was the
	case. This is because those are the most important parts. However, we
	were told to also discuss the requirements, and something about the 
	future recommendations. Other chapters like proejct approach, ethical
	implications and problem analysis should not be included.

- Rethinking the project approach chapter?
	- To what extent is the informatino relevant to the target audience?
	Not all of this information is relevant to the reader, but there are
	some bits which should remain, such as parts of the development approach,
	as well as some of the constraints, however, not in this chapter. The
	constraints could be added to the requirements chapter instead.

- Based on the coach feedback, we should incorporate images in the in the introduction,
how should be goa bout this?
	- If it is relevant for any of the introduction chapters, we should include it
	otherwise, it is better if we don't include it at all.


- Difficulties regarding client communication?
	- This could be discussed in the evaluation part of the project. In that chapter
	we should reflect on it, however, it should be kept in mind that the client is
	still the target audience.

- Is aiming for the word limit something we should do?
	- No need to add stuff just to reach the word limit.

- Can we have appendices and what is the preference?
	- We are allowed to have appendices, however, the grade depends on the content
	of the appendix. We should change the order of it, as it seems that Appendix C
	is more important than Appendix A and B, so those two could be moved to the end.
	
- Given the current state of the report, would you consider us on track for a passing grade?
	- If we implement all the changes mentioned in the feedback, then it certainly
	would be a passing grade, as of now it wouldn't since it is a work in progress.

- The appendices should be sorted based on the order in which they are sorted in the report,
but also some contents of the appendices which do not have to be refereced. In case they are
not referenced, we should put them after the referenced appendices, and sort them based on 
some importance.

- Keep the feedback in mind, both the current one and the previous feedback received. Check
the assignment criteria because that is something that has to be met in order for us to pass,
otherwise it would mean we fail no matter the quality of the report.
