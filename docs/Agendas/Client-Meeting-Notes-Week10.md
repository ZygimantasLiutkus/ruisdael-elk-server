## Feedback on the product

- Changes to be made:
    -  "Submit Query" change to "Login" has been made
    - Update to the href of Kibana was been introduced
    - Changes to the README file on the Client side
    - WSL issue can be ignored.
    - Changes to `conf.d` file
    - Issue with PIP on node MRR004. In order to solve write down the commands which would be ran manually on a Windows machine, and upload that.
    - For the Kibana dashboard we need to SSH to the TUDelft network using: `ssh -machine -D -port`, then go to the browser and switch the settings to `Manual Proxy` where we use `SOCKS Host` and change it to the `port` which is being used for the SSH connection. This should resovle the issue.
