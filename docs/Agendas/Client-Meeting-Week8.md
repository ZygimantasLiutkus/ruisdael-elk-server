# Client Meeting 14/06/2023

- Chair: Dean Polimac
- Minute taker: Å½ygimantas Liutkus

## Plan

- Feedback on the presentation
- Show demo
- Go over the node pausing feature. It seems a bit too difficult to implement it, unless the client would be satisfied
    with us just ignoring the node? This should be further clarified.
