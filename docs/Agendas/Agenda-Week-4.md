# Agenda Week 4
Chair: Dean Polimac

Minute taker: Å½ygimantas Liutkus

## Client Meeting - Monday, 15.05.2023

- Clarify all the requirements & what are their expectations from us.
    - Considering the current requirements seem to be rather trivial when relying on ELK Stack - as it only requires us to install certain packages and design a drag and drop dashboard.

- Inform them that we are required to do some coding and ask for which exact requirements we should provide our alternative, instead of using ELK Stack.
    - Parts of ELK Stack which could potentially be substituted include Heartbeat (pinging the server), CPU, RAM and Storage usage monitoring, the process of sending\receiving requests to the server, anomaly detection in data (The client has had some issues understanding how this would be done, so might need to explain).

- Offer online meetings as an alternative, considering so far two of our meetings have been canceled.
    - We should stress out the imporatance of these meetings especially at this time, considering we did not meet in the previous weeks.

- Cover the design of the dashboard and what it needs to have.
    - Show the demo of what we have in Kibana now.
    - Get a clarification of the web UI and what they mean by dashboard.

- When they are available for the midterm meetings, in terms of data & time, if it is gonna be online or in person?
    - Our available times would be:
        - Tuesday: 8:45-12:30 or After 17:00
        - Wednesday: 8:45-10:00, 12:00-14:00
        - Thursday: 8:45-13:00
        - Friday: 8:00-9:30

- Check the following:
    - Top 3 incidents which should be prevented
    - What exactly are "data malfunctions"
    - How many devices are in the network
    - Can we be provided with an image of one of the devices.
