# Week 5 Notes - TA Meeting

## Presentation dates
 - Midterm: Thursday, 1st of June, 13h-14h
 - Final: TA preference unavailable on Friday 30th, from 11:00-12:30

 ## Requirements Status
  - Splitting the work into writing code for TUDelft, but also installing the necessary ELK Stack stuff for the client is fine
  - We need to tell the client that we cannot introduce large changes at this point, however, emphasize that we will install the scripts (ELK) as they required us.
  - In case the client does not want us to install our code on their devices, we can install it on our devices for the purpose of creating the demo.
  
## Grading
  - The merge requests should be made by everyone since it shows our interaction with others based on their feedback.
  - Issues and documentation are important for grading
  - We should start including sprint retrospectives and manage sprints better to improve the grading
  - Retrospectives should include things that went well, things that should be improved on, and things that we will improve in the following week.
  - Include the drafts and prototypes in the presentation followed by explanations, as well as the research for the ML part of the project and a argumentative discussion of our choices.

## Important points
 - Upload the retrospectives and notes in a docs file (maybe create a docs branch)
 - Checklist in the issues
 - Put the pipeline on the main branch for both the server and client side
 - Merge to main at least once a week, preferably before the meeting
