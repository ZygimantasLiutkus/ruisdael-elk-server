		- communication a bit rough
		- Sugest online meeting -> did it already
		- setup specific time slots 1h each
		- You have to meet this week, without it can't proceed
			- if canceled again, contact TA
	- ans scope to small?
		- not that much code to write
			- only install premade software
		- server only via documentation
		- client via script
		- doesn't look that complex at the moment
		- Can we create our own metric beats? agrigation, talk about it with the client
		- otherwise only ansible
		- don't really know it this will be enough
		- have meeting, look at requirements, TA will go to coordinators with them
