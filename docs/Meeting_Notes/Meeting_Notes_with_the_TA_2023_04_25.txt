	- 2 separate repositories on GitLab, should make a plan 
		what we want to put in which repo, and which settings 
		the repos should have

	- During the next client meeting, we should check if we need to
		sync our repo with their repo
	- GitLab pipelines, set up docker, for the docker image specify
		the docker version so that it doesn't download everything
